This wasn't a movie it was "the change" in passive sense.it was a bloody slap on the face of Indian cinema entertainment.nothing was of sense ,cant be categorized under any category.was it done just for money making by taking big stars and releasing on Christmas. May god Save the Indian cinema from the bad effects of upcoming nonsense movies Like this. Never watch this movie .... Few stupid things to be noticed: -- -poor jokes, poorly executed action sequences –dialogues full of overacting. –good actors were not able to show their talents due to bad direction and poor script. –promotion was done as if a blockbuster movie was going to be released.

A strict law should be made to check the movie's quality before its release, because its just like robbing viewers pocket in a gentle way ..
